# [Carl Vereen's Event Planner Web app Project 1]

Meet-Up Event Planner project 1 is developed for Senior Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

1) Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

    * Name
    * Email address
    * Secure password (with character and length requirements)
    * Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2) The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

    * Name of the event
    * Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
    * Event host (could be an individualâ€™s name or an organization)
    * Event start date and time
    * Event end date and time
    * Guest list
    * Location
    * Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event
